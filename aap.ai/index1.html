	    <h1 class="tittle">Why aapoon – Our Story</h1>
		<img src="img/divider.svg">
	    <h3 class="subTit">1. Trust is a Must</h3>
		<p class="para1">We believe that it’s time to start <strong>rebuilding trust</strong> in social media. People are constantly being scammed on social media via fake and duplicate accounts. The volume of fake content steadily makes new highs – often causing social and economic discord. Many governments are now extremely concerned with the generation of this large volume of fake content and are looking to implement regulation to address this. Scarier still is that many social platforms have allowed underage children to join them, putting these children at risk.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFB431;" class="para1">The aapoon Way</p>
		<p class="para1">On aapoon, all our users are real people. Our users are fully verified with government-issued photo ID using our world-leading facial recognition technology. This means that there are no duplicate or fake accounts on aapoon. This also means that the generation of fake content is reduced significantly.</p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
	  <div class="col-md-7">
	    <h3 class="subTit">2. Unmatched Privacy</h3>
		<p class="para1">We also believe that privacy is a right of social media users. It is a well-known fact that the existing social media companies constantly collect user’s clicks and keyboard strokes and user’s data is being sold to third parties with no regard to data privacy.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFB431;" class="para1">The aapoon Way</p>
		<p class="para1">We offer a level of privacy that is unmatched. Our users are provided with options to make their data private from other users. Further, aapoon commits its users that their personal information will never leave the platform or sold to third parties.</p>
	    <h3 class="subTit">3. Distribute the Wealth</h3>
		<p class="para1">Today, the significant wealth that is generated from social media user data is owned and controlled by a few companies and their major shareholders. Users get no monetary benefit for their data from the social media apps and platforms that they use.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFB431;" class="para1">The aapoon Way</p>
		<p class="para1">aapoon understands that users are the backbone of social media. We are, therefore, willing to share our revenues with our users – based on their level of usage of the platform.</p>

	    <img style="width:100%;" src="img/Indian Youth.png" class="img-responsive">
		<h3 class="subTit">Combining Social Media with Messaging</h3>
		<p class="para1">In addition to the points mentioned above, aapoon is also the only social media app integrated with a messaging platform called Chit-Chat. It is not only robust but also offers features and functions that users have been asking for, but have not been available – until now.</p>
		<p class="para1">For starters, our messaging groups allow an unlimited number of users. Also, group admins and users are provided with tools to better manage their messages. Additional features that we will be launching in the coming weeks and months will also include additional capabilities that will not only be world-wide firsts but will also be features that users have been asking for. To learn more about these capabilities, we invite you to download and start using aapoon. Join our social revolution!</p>

			<p>But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.</p>

			<p>Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.</p>

          <p>My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning.  The morning papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.</p>

		  <p>The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  The telegram concluded with the words: "Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy."  On that last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.</p>
